## Problem Description

We investigate the probability that `n` ducks randomly placed in a circle happen to fall in a semicircle.

## Theoretical Probability

- For 4 ducks, convex quadrilateral ⇔ points not on same semicircle
- For n ducks, convex polygon ⇔ points not in same semicircle (generalization)
- Probability formula derivation...

# Monte Carlo Simulation

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(envir = globalenv())
```

```{r load}
source("../src/utils.r")
source("../src/monte_carlo.r")
```

```{r monte carlo}
set.seed(123)
monte_carlo(n = 4, trials = 50000)
```
